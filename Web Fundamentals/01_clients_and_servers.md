# Clients and Servers
The client-server model is a widely used architectural pattern in computer networking and web development. It refers to a distributed computing model where tasks and responsibilities are divided between two entities: the client and the server.

In the client-server model:

1. Client: The client is the user-facing part of the application or system. It can be a computer, a mobile device, or any device with the ability to request and display information. The client sends requests to the server and receives responses. Clients are typically equipped with web browsers or applications that interact with the server to access resources or perform actions.

2. Server: The server is the central component that provides services or resources to clients. It can be a physical computer or a virtual machine running software designed to respond to client requests. Servers are responsible for storing, managing, and processing data, as well as executing business logic. They listen for incoming requests from clients, process those requests, and send back the requested information or perform the requested actions.

The communication between the client and server is typically facilitated through a network, often the internet. The client initiates a request by sending a message to the server, specifying the desired action or resource. The server receives the request, processes it, and generates a response, which is then sent back to the client. This communication usually occurs using protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure).

The client-server model allows for scalability, as multiple clients can connect to a single server or a group of servers to access resources or services. It also enables the separation of concerns, with the server handling the complex processing and data management tasks, while the client focuses on presenting information to the user and handling user interactions.

It's important to note that the client-server model is not limited to web development but is a fundamental concept in various computing domains, including networked applications, database systems, and cloud computing.

Overall, the client-server model provides a structured approach to building distributed systems, allowing for efficient resource utilization and enabling collaboration between different components of an application or system.
