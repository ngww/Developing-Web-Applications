# URLS
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It's the address or the unique identifier of a resource on the internet. URLs are used to access web pages, files, images, videos, and other resources.

Let's break down a URL into its components using an example: 

URL: https://www.example.com/path/page.html?id=123

1. Protocol: The protocol is the first part of the URL, and it specifies the communication protocol to be used. In this case, it's "https://" which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It ensures that the communication between your device and the web server is encrypted and secure.

2. Domain: The domain is the second part of the URL and identifies the website or the server where the resource is hosted. In the example, the domain is "www.example.com". It often starts with "www" but not always. The domain name can be followed by a top-level domain (TLD) like ".com", ".org", or a country-specific TLD like ".co.uk".

3. Path: The path specifies the location of a specific file or page on the server. In the example, "/path/page.html" represents the path. It indicates that the file "page.html" is located in the directory "path" on the server.

4. Query Parameters: Query parameters are additional information passed to the server to provide specific instructions or data. They start with a question mark "?" and are separated by an ampersand "&" if there are multiple parameters. In the example, "id=123" is a query parameter. It indicates that the value of the "id" parameter is "123".

URLs can contain additional components like fragments (identified by a hash "#" symbol), which refer to a specific section within a web page.

Remember that URLs are used by web browsers to locate and retrieve resources from web servers. By understanding the different components of a URL, you can better navigate and access the content you want on the internet.
