# Lists
In HTML, there are three main types of lists: unordered lists (`<ul>`), ordered lists (`<ol>`), and definition lists (`<dl>`). Here's how you can use these list types:

1. Unordered List (`<ul>`):
   - Use the `<ul>` element to create an unordered list.
   - Each list item is represented by the `<li>` element.
   - Example:

   ```html
   <ul>
     <li>Item 1</li>
     <li>Item 2</li>
     <li>Item 3</li>
   </ul>
   ```

   Output:
   - Item 1
   - Item 2
   - Item 3

2. Ordered List (`<ol>`):
   - Use the `<ol>` element to create an ordered list.
   - Each list item is represented by the `<li>` element.
   - Example:

   ```html
   <ol>
     <li>First item</li>
     <li>Second item</li>
     <li>Third item</li>
   </ol>
   ```

   Output:
   1. First item
   2. Second item
   3. Third item

3. Definition List (`<dl>`):
   - Use the `<dl>` element to create a definition list.
   - Each term in the list is represented by the `<dt>` element, and its definition is represented by the `<dd>` element.
   - Example:

   ```html
   <dl>
     <dt>Term 1</dt>
     <dd>Definition 1</dd>
     <dt>Term 2</dt>
     <dd>Definition 2</dd>
   </dl>
   ```

   Output:
   Term 1
   Definition 1
   Term 2
   Definition 2

You can nest lists inside other lists to create nested or hierarchical structures. Simply include the appropriate list elements `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<dl>` within the `<li>` elements of the parent list.

Lists are versatile and can be used for various purposes, such as creating menus, navigation, or displaying information in a structured manner.
