# Basic HTML
Here's an example of a basic HTML document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" width="200" height="150">
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a> to visit Example.com.
</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down the different parts:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is the document type declaration, which tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.

- `<html>`: This is the root element of the HTML document.

- `<head>`: This element contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title of the page, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, etc.

- `<title>`: This element sets the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

- `<body>`: This element represents the content of the HTML document and contains all the visible elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

- `<h1>`: This is a heading element. There are six levels of headings, `<h1>` being the highest and `<h6>` being the lowest.

- `<p>`: This is a paragraph element. It is used to define a paragraph of text.

- `<img>`: This is an image element. It is used to insert an image into the page. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image file, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image.

- `<a>`: This is an anchor element, commonly known as a hyperlink. It is used to create links to other web pages or resources. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the linked page.
