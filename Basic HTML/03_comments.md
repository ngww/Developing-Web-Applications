# Comments
HTML comments are used to add explanatory or informative notes within an HTML code that are not displayed in the web browser. They are useful for adding comments to your code to provide explanations, reminders, or instructions for other developers or for your future reference. HTML comments are ignored by the browser and do not affect the rendering of the web page.

Here's an example of how to use HTML comments:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- This is a comment. It provides additional information about the following code. -->
  <h1>Welcome to my Web Page!</h1>
  
  <p>This is some text that is visible on the web page.</p>
  
  <!--
  <p>This is a commented out paragraph.</p>
  <p>These paragraphs will not be displayed in the browser.</p>
  -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the first comment is placed above the `<h1>` tag, providing a description of what it represents. The second comment is used to disable a portion of the code by wrapping the `<p>` tags. These commented out paragraphs will not be displayed in the browser when the page is rendered.

By using comments effectively, you can improve the readability and maintainability of your HTML code, especially when working collaboratively or revisiting your code at a later time.
